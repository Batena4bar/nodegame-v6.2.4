      Your group needs to decide on which commodities for the charity to invest in <em>upfront</em>, in order to maximise the number of meals they are able to produce throughout the year. You will be given information provided by Analysts who have been hired by the charity to forecast information for the coming year. You will each receive information from separate analysts, therefore, some of your information will overlap and some will not. You need to predict the rise (or fall) of the prices for each commodity throughout the coming year. Once you have done this, the <em>best practice</em> is to purchase more of the commodities whose prices you believe will <em>increase throughout the coming year</em> and less of those you believe will decrease.
