    <div id="instructions">
      This game is played in rounds by two human players randomly paired.
      <br><br>

      Together, you form a small team responsible for buying food at the best cost for a national charity who provide food kitchens for the homeless across the UK. Since the kitchens rely most heavily on <em>coffee</em>, <em>wheat</em> and <em>sugar</em> for their meals, they have decided, where it is most beneficial, to purchase and store supplies of these commodities <em>every April</em>, after receiving their largest, yearly donation of Â£1.2 million. These purchases are intended to protect against any significant price shocks throughout the year, as well as helping to maximise the number of meals the charities are able to make from the donations.
