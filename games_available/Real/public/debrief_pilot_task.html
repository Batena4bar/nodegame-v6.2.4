                This experiment was designed to closely resemble a management team decision. This experiment is a
                trail for a new form of experiment designed to assess teammateâ€™s tendencies to act cooperatively with one another.
                The method we use to evaluate a lack of cooperation is the degreee to which participants display a bias in the way they share information and the way they
                take on new information provided by thier teammates. Specifically, this experiment was designed to test the 
                hypothesis that a worry assossiated with something outside the decision-making group increases cooperative 
                tendencies, in contrast, a worry assossiated with something inside the decision-making group decreases cooperative tendencies.

                The red slides labeled "The Situation", if applied, were the method used to attempt to evoke mild worry in the participants of this study.
