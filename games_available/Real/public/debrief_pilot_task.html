                This experiment was designed to closely resemble a management team decision. This experiment was a
                trail for
                a new form of experiment designed to assess peopleâ€™s tendencies to act cooperative with their task
                mates.
                Primarily, we are interested in whether people display a bias in how they share information and how they
                take on board new information. This experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that a worry
                generated
                from outside the decision-making group increases cooperative tendencies, in contrast, a worry generated
                from
                inside the decision-making group decreases cooperative tendencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this pilot study, only the task itself was undertaken. No causes for worry were implimented. And no
                method of evaluation of your performance was carried out.
