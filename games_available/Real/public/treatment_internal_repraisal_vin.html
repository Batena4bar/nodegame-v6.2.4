      <h3>Imagine you are at work and have recently become part of a team. Within your
        team, you have noticed some of your teammate's becoming increasingly angry every time someone would give a
        suggestion they do not deem
        as valuable.
        It has got to the point where you are unsure how they are going to react towards you if tensions keep rising.

      </h3>
