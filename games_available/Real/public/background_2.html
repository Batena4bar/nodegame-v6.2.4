      Your team needs to decide on which commodities for the charity to invest in upfront, in order to maximise the
      number of set meals they are able to produce throughout the year. Analysts have been hired by the charity to
      provide you with forecast information for the coming year.
      <br><br>
      You will each receive information from separate analysts, therefore, some of your information will overlap and
      some will not.
      <br><br>
      You need to predict the rise (or fall) of the prices for each commodity throughout the coming year. Once you have
      done this, the best practice is to purchase more of the commodity(s) whose price(s) you believe is going to
      increase the most throughout the year and less of those you believe will decrease.
      <br><br>
      If you knew for certain which commodity would increase the most, you would invest all the donations in that
      commodity.
