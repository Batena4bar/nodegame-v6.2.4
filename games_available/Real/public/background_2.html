      <p>
        Using the limited amount of information you have been provided about each manager, your 
        group must determine an optimal allocation of the 12 kitchens between the new managers. To do so, 
        your group must assess which of the new candidates are most likely to be the 
        best manager(s) and allocate a greater number of kitchens to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some information about the candidates will be shared between multiple members of your group, other information will only be given to single group members. Groups tend to perform better when they share more information with each other.
