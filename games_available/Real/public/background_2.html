      <p>
        Using the limited amount of information you have been provided about each manager, your 
        group must determine an optimal allocation of the 12 kitchens between the new managers. To do so, 
        your group must assess which of the new candidates are most likely to be the 
        best manager(s) and allocate a greater number of kitchens to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Poor management of these kitchens has been shown to have far and away the greatest impact on the number of homeless who are left without food. Therefore, the charity wants you to allocate as many kitchens as possible to the best candidate(s).
      </p>
      <p>
        Sharing information should increase your group's ability to perform well on the task.
