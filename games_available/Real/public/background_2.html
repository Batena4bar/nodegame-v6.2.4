      <p>
        Using the limited amount of information you have been provided about each new recruit, your 
        group must determine an optimal allocation of the 12 kitchens between the new managers. To do so, 
        your group must give more kitchens to the new recruit(s) you believe are most likely to be the 
        best manager(s). The more kitchens with poor management the more homeless will end up going 
        without food.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will each be provided with some information. Some pieces of information will be given to everybody within the group. Other pieces of
        information will only be given to one individual within the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sharing information should increase your group's ability to perform well on the task.
