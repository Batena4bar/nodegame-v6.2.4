        All three candidates would like to manage as many kitchen as they can. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Poor management of these kitchens has been shown to have far and away the greatest impact on the 
        number of homeless who are left without food. Therefore, the charity wants you to allocate as many 
        kitchens as they can to the best candidate(s).
      </p>
      <p>
        If it is obvious that one candidate is better than the others, then it is preferable to allocate all of the kitchens to that candidate. However, if it is not clear which candidate is best, then it is usually preferable to go with a more blanaced allocation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more kitchens you allocate to the best candidate in the final group decision, the higher the payment you will receive at the end of this task.
