      As a group, you need to use the information provided to try to predict how the price of
      each food type will change throughout the coming year. Once you have done this, you should use your budget to
      <strong>purchase the foods you believe will have the greatest increase in price</strong> over the coming year. (If
      you believe that all 3 food types will decrease in price, then you would purchase the foods whose price you
      believe will decrease the
      least.)
      <br><br>
      <strong>Example</strong>: In the event that you were confident the price of Sugar would
      rise more than the price of both Wheat and Coffee. Then the best method would be invest
      all your available budget in Sugar.
