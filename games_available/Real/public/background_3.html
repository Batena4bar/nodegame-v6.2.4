      Your group needs to use the information provided to try to <strong>predict how the price of
        each food type might change</strong> throughout the coming year. Once you have done this, you should use your
      budget to
      purchase the foods you believe will <strong>increase the most in price</strong>.
      <br><br>
      (For clarity; If you believed that all prices would decrease, then you would purchase the food[s] that will
      <strong>decrease
        the least</strong> in price.)

all your available budget in Sugar.
