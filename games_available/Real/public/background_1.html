        You and two other group members are responsible for buying food for a charity that provides food kitchens for
        the homeless.
      </p>
      <p>
        The kitchens depend mostly on <strong>coffee</strong>, <strong>wheat</strong> and <strong>sugar</strong> for
        their meals. Donations to the charity have provided you with a budget of <strong>Â£12M</strong> to purchase a
        combination of these three food types, to store and use throughout the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of buying some of these foods now is to try to <strong>reduce the average cost of a meal</strong>
        for the charity. Your group needs to decide <strong>which food types would be best to purchase now</strong>,
        to get the most from the charity's budget.
