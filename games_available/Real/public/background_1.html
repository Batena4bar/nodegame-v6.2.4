      You and the two other group members are responsible for buying food for a charity that provides food kitchens for
      the homeless.
      <br><br>
      The kitchens depend mostly on <strong>coffee</strong>, <strong>wheat</strong> and <strong>sugar</strong> for
      their meals. Donations to the charity have provided you with a budget of <strong>Â£1.2M</strong> to purchase a
      combination of these three food types, to store and use throughout the year.
      <br><br>
      The purpose of buying some of these foods now is to try to <strong>minimise the average cost of each meal</strong>
      throughout the year. Your group needs to decide <strong>which food types would be best to purchase now</strong>,
      to get
      the most out of the budget provided.
