      You three form a small group responsible for buying food at the best cost for a national charity that provides
      food kitchens for the homeless across the UK.
      <br><br>
      Since the kitchens rely most heavily on coffee, wheat and sugar for their meals, they have decided to purchase and
      store supplies of these commodities every April, after receiving their largest, yearly donation of Â£1.2 million.
      <br><br>
      These purchases are intended to protect against any significant price shocks throughout the year, as well as
      helping to maximise the number of meals the charities are able to make from the donations.
