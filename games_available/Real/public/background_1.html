      <p>
        You are on the board of a charity that provides soup kitchens which feed the homeless 
        across the UK. The global COVID pandemic has forced one of your best and most capable 
        regional managers to leave the charity, leaving 12 kitchens without the leadership they 
        require. Upper management have had to make a quick decision and have shortlisted three new 
        regional managers, intending to split the management of the 12 kitchens between them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Each new manager has shown great interest in the position and would like to be in charge of as many kitchens as possible.
