      <h3>About the research</h3>

      <h5>Who will conduct the research?</h5>
      <p>
        Mr Samuel Bateman, Alliance Business School - Innovation, Management and Policy Division in The University of
        Manchester.
      </p>

      <h5>What is the purpose of the research?</h5>
      <p>
        The purpose of this research is to understand how people make decisions in groups. This research is aimed at
        developing a new experimental method for studying group decision making.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participants have been recruited, through the online participant pool Prolific. And have been selected to take
        part
        as they meet the necessary English speaking requirements for this study.
      </p>
      <h5>Will the outcomes of the research be published?</h5>
      <p>
        This research is intended to be used as part of a PhD student thesis in business and management. It is also
        intended
        to be published as part of a paper written for a scientific journal.
      </p>
      <h5>Who has reviewed the research project?</h5>
      <p>
        <mark>This study has been reviewed by The Alliance Manchester Business School's Research Ethics
          Committee.</mark>
      </p>
      <h5>What are the potential risks?</h5>
      <p>
        You may find the task mildly uncomfortable, as is sometimes the case when working collaboratively as part of a
        group. <mark>If you have a history of depression and/or anxiety, then you should not take part in this
          study.</mark>
      </p>
      <h3>Your involvement</h3>

      <h5>What would I be asked to do if I took part?</h5>
      <p>
        You will be asked to work online as a team comprising other human participants to make decisions in a 'food
        purchasing' task. You will need to read and discuss information about the options given to identify the best
        one.
        Along the way, you and the other participants will be asked to make judgments and decisions about the task and
        the
        team. The task should take around 30 minutes from start to finish.
      </p>
      <h5>Will I be compensated for taking part?</h5>
      <p>
        Each participant will receive a payoff proportional to their group’s performance within the task. The minimum
        you
        can receive is £2.50 and the maximum is £7.
      </p>
      <p>
        <mark>Due to the nature of the task, it is not possible to pay partial rewards to participants. Therefore,
          participants who withdraw from the study will be paid at the base rate of £5/ hour for thier time.</mark>
      </p>
      <h5>What happens if I do not want to take part or if I change my
        mind?</h5>
      <p>
        It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do not wish to take part in the study, please
        close
        this window and all related windows. If you do decide to take part you are welcome to screenshot this
        information
        or download a copy at the end of the experiment. You will also be asked to tick a box to give confirmation of
        your
        consent to take part in the study. <mark>If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time
          without
          giving a reason and without detriment to yourself (including whilst undertaking the task).</mark> However, it
        is not possible to remove your data from the
        project once it has been anonymised as we will not be able to identify your specific data. This does not affect
        your
        data protection rights. If you decide not to take part you do not need to do anything further.
      </p>
