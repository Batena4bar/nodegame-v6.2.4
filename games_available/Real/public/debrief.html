            <mark>This experiment was designed to closely resemble a management team decision. This experiment was a
                trail for
                a new form of experiment designed to assess peopleâ€™s tendencies to act cooperative with their task
                mates.
                Primarily, we are interested in whether people display a bias in how they share information and how they
                take on board new information. This experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that a worry
                generated
                from outside the decision-making group increases cooperative tendencies, in contrast, a worry generated
                from
                inside the decision-making group decreases cooperative tendencies.
                <br><br>
                Biases associated with non-cooperative tendencies: a tendency of one to share information that is
                consistent
                with their current beliefs & a
                tendency of one to give a higher weight to information provided by others that is consistent with one's
                current beliefs.</mark>
