            This experiment was designed to closely resemble a management team decision and was used to examine how
            certain
            cooperative aspects of group decision making (a willingness to adopt other's options and a willingness to
            share information that
            opposes one's opinion) change under different forms of task related 'threat'. Here, we predicted that
            threats
            applied from outside of the group would cause greater cooperative tendencies and threats originating from
            inside
            the group would cause a reduction in cooperative tendencies.

            The experiment was a pilot study for a novel experiment design. The study was a between-subject design. The
            independent variable was the ‘IMPORTANT NOTE’ section of the task. The dependent variables were metrics
            signaling:
            a willingness to adopt other's options and a willingness to share information that opposes one's own
            opinions.
