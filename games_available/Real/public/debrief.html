            This experiment is designed to examine the how certain aspects of group information sharing changes under
            different types of task related fear conditions. Previous work has shown that, depending on certain features
            of an induction, fear can cause differing observable changes to participant behaviours. Here, our interest
            was in whether fears from an external source caused greater cooperative tendencies and fears from an
            internal source caused negative tendencies.
            <br><br>
            The experiment was a pilot study for a novel experiment design. The study was a between-subject design. The
            independent variable is the ‘IMPORTANT NOTE’ fear manipulation. The dependent variables are linked to which
            pieces of information were shared during the group discussion and how preferences changed post discussion.
            <br><br>
            The purpose of the statistical analysis is to determine whether, when in receipt of information that is both
            for and against on’s own position, externally sourced fears cause a greater tendency to share information in
            a more balanced fashion and internally sourced fears cause a greater tendency to share information in a less
            balanced fashion. The null hypothesis is that there will be no significant difference.
